# Heart Disease Prediction

This project, completed as part of the Winter 2024 Machine Learning semester at VSB Technical University of Ostrava, focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes.

## Project Description

Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project employs machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The `heart.csv` file contains the medical data used for training and evaluating the model.

- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook `Heart_Failure.ipynb` documents the entire process, including data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and performance evaluation.

## Accessing the Notebook

You can view and run the notebook on Google Colab via the following link:

## Algorithms Used

Several classification algorithms were explored to identify the most accurate predictor:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 82%, indicating promising performance in heart disease prediction.
